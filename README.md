# Profile
just more stuff for my profile!!


I have affilations with Cosmic Network, i am 13, live in usa, iq over 160 (if you know me then you could tell), and have shut down an entire countys computer newtwork on accident lol. I am not Echo (3kh0) btw. 

I started my coding journey on scratch (like many others) I made my first game prob around 2017. I followed a simple tutorial but i was pround. fast forward to like 2019 and i start making alot more stuff, learning by remixing other games and editing. Eventaully my schools blocking service blcoked scratch and i was bored. in late 2022 i tried python but quit bc i didnt know much about coding. early 2023 and my friend (boatu) taught me alot about github and hosting. I used this to host my first few things on another account. I was using chatGPT to help with so much and mostly create all the code. my friend also taught me about static sites and Gitpod. 

Now this is where my "real" journey begins. I finally entered a class in 2023 first semi that teaches me some usful html and css. We then do js and I am pretty good at it (we used code.org.) I made a few games to advance my knowledge.  In like nov 2023 i start my first real github pages site with games. It was really just html and forking other repos then putting them on my site. It did help me learn more about hosting, html, and js. I kept adding stuff like a password which took longer than it should have but taught me more about js. In dec 2023 I announced that the site would no longer get update as alot of the games were not working and it would take to much work to fix. This was a reason but the main reason was to work on another thing. With boatu we started to make our own game site using a library of games. This was quickly scrapped after Echo provided a better lib. We have plans for the site but first i need to do some stuff that i keep forgeting lol. 

I am starting to learn python again with help from a friend. I am planning to get some blank usb drives and put some files that echo used. Currently as i am looking for where i saw his basicly life history i decided to make this. This might be updated more maybe not tho.
